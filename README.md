# Dengue-Prediction
The objective of this project whereby our task will be to predict the number of dengue cases based on week of year per location. These dengue cases are predicted based on environmental factors that contribute to the outbreak of this dengue disease. For example, the changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and more. The purpose of these prediction analysis is for the people of the affected area to be able to prepare themselves and take precautions. Not only that, an understanding relationship between this disease and the contributing environmental factors can help further improvements of research initiatives to curb this life-threatening pandemic that has been going on for years now. With the help of data driven technology, we hope to fight this dengue disease. The next objective would be to apply the knowledge of data cleaning, analysis, as well as web scraping to obtain the prediction of dengue cases. Besides that, we also aim to contribute to the SDG 3 - Good Health & Well-Being by carrying out prediction analysis.
